## üìö About the project: 

Simple static page made with the aim of reviewing basic concepts of React.

Since we are stepping into a world ruled by technology and we have a serious issue with deforestation, we need to start thinking about ways that we can help the planet while keeping up with improvements.

Traditional business cards can be a problem. We print them in a large scales and it's easy for people to loose them or even put them into the trash 10 seconds after receiving them. We are waisting money and paper.

So one way of improving this sitution is using digital business cards. No more wasting paper and more money saved. Just one digital business card and you can pass it around the globe.
